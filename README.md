Bonus Assignment for the ML-lecture for WWI-DSA-18 at DHBW Mannheim

In this Repository I worked on Copycat CNN and Knockoff Nets via their respectiv Trusted-AI implementation in the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox.

In addition because those did not work properly I captured the idea of a copycat cnn in a simple transfer learning approch:
I took a trained classifier used by a fellow student and tried if I could perform simular performance by taking a pretrained VGG and using a not problem domain specific dataset (cifar100).
